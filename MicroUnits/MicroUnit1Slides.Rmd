# Issues with Sport Science Data 



* Abundance of data (and sources)
--
<br>
  * From varying technologies at differing sample rates
--
<br>
  * Often stored in multiple file formats

<br>
--


* Datasets often need (manual) cleaning and merging
--
<br>
  * Likely performed in programs external to data capture source
  
<br>
--


* Extensive process to import, analyse and visualise data
--
<br>
  * Often performed in a siloed, time-consuming manner
--
<br>
  * Issues with reproducibility

# Setting up the R Workspace

1. Ensure R and RStudio are downloaded. 
<br>
<br>
--

2. Create a new project in RStudio: `File -> New Project -> New Directory -> New Project`.

.center[

* Using this approach will contain all your files, scripts and data in one location


* Avoids having multiple .R and .RData files scattered within and across multiple folders!
---

class: left, top
.center[
# Setting up the R Workspace (cont.)
]


* Create a folder within your new project (either via RStudio or manually) named "Data"


--

* Next, copy the example data (.xlsx) downloaded file into this "Data" folder

* Ensure the packages below are installed or up-to-date:
